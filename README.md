"# Standard-Eule" 

I am working my way through the Project Euler problems and solving them all in Python. In the process, I am learning Python, so a large amount of my time is spent searching the web for various features. I have been coding in Java since 2010.

This was inspired by nayuki, who has many solutions in Java, Python, Haskell, and mathematica. His project can be found here: https://github.com/nayuki/Project-Euler-solutions.

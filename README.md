"# Standard-Eule" 

I am working my way through the Project Euler programs and solving them all in Python. In the process, I am learning Python, so a large amount of my time is spent searching the web for various features. I have been coding in Java since 2011, but am expanding my knowledge now.

This was inspired by nayuki who has complete solutions to the Euler Project in java and partial solutions in python, Haskell, and mathematica. His project can be found here: https://github.com/nayuki/Project-Euler-solutions. I check all of my final answers with his.

The projects can be found here: https://projecteuler.net/archives

"# Standard-Eule" 

I am working my way through the Project Euler programs and solving them all in Python. In the process, I am learning Python, so a large amount of my time is spent searching the web for various features. I have been coding in Java since 2011, but am expanding my knowledge now.

The projects can be found here: https://projecteuler.net/archives
